# Power-Wilcoxon-Test
On this test, we want to see the performance of the Wilcoxon test statistics subject to the sample size. Below we have the plots for different values of n = sample size. The hypothesis are: ![testing](https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=H_0%3A+%5Cmu_1+%3D+%5Cmu_2+vs+H_1%3A+%5Cmu_1+%3E+%5Cmu_2). We can see that the power increases as the n sample size increases
